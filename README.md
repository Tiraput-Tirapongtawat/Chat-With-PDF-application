# Chat-With-PDF-application
Chat with PDF using RAG, FastAPI, and LangChain This project demonstrates an intelligent document-querying system built with Python, FastAPI, and LLM libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable natural language interactions with PDF files.

# Background
We are trying to catch up with the current trends in LLM, we have a bunch of papers
downloaded from the internet. We need your help to create a Chat With PDF application.

# How Does It Work?
The API has three main endpoints:

Query Endpoint (/query/):

  Description: This endpoint accepts a user query and retrieves relevant context from a Chroma database.
  Process:
  The query is embedded using a language model.
  A similarity search is performed in Chroma to retrieve context based on the query.
  A prompt is dynamically generated, incorporating both the retrieved context and any prior conversation history.
  The generated prompt is sent to the language model, which produces a response.
  The query-response pair is stored in memory for future context.

Show History Endpoint (/history/):

  Description: Returns a history of all queries and responses in the current session.
  Usage: Useful for tracking conversation flow and providing a cohesive interaction experience for users.

Clear Memory Endpoint (/clear_memory/):

  Description: Resets the conversation memory, clearing any stored queries and responses.
  Usage: Allows users to start a new session without any retained context from previous interactions.


# Running Locally with Docker Compose

# Future Improvement

**1.Enhanced Query Processing:**

Incorporate more sophisticated embeddings or custom-trained models to improve context retrieval.
Introduce mechanisms to better handle ambiguous queries by asking clarifying questions.
Scalability and Performance:

**2. Scalability and Performance:**
   
Implement caching for frequently accessed information to reduce response latency.
Consider using Redis or another in-memory database for faster retrieval of conversation history and embedding cache.

**3. Security Enhancements:**

Add authentication and authorization to restrict access to the API.
Encrypt sensitive data, such as API keys, using secure key management practices.
Analytics and Monitoring:

**4. Analytics and Monitoring:**

Integrate logging and monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track metrics like latency, error rates, and user interactions.
Use these insights to improve system performance and user experience.
User Feedback Mechanism:

**5. User Feedback Mechanism: **

Introduce a feedback system that allows users to rate responses. Use this data to improve model performance or adjust response generation.
Language Support:

**6. Language Support:**
Enable multi-language support to expand usability for a global audience.
