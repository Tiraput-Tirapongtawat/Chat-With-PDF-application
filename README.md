# Chat-With-PDF-application
Chat with PDF using RAG, FastAPI, and LangChain This project demonstrates an intelligent document-querying system built with Python, FastAPI, and LLM libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable natural language interactions with PDF files.

# Background
We are trying to catch up with the current trends in LLM, we have a bunch of papers
downloaded from the internet. We need your help to create a Chat With PDF application (UI is
not needed, being able to ask and get responses is enough).
